        <h2>Problem:</h2>
          <p>There is still much to improve upon existing cloud storage products
            to meet the growing demands of users. After taking the time to listen
            to users, I came to understand their main concerns with current apps
            involve security, the amount of storage space available to them and
            problems understanding the user interface.</p>
        <h2>Solution:</h2>
          <p>The Seraph cloud storage app is a professional platform that
            provides a simple solution to give users the tools to store and
            access their work on the web easily and securely. Seraph allows
            users to create, upload and organize their online documents and
            folders on the cloud space efficiently. Collaboration is made easy
            through secure links and email sharing. The storage plans give users
            plenty of space for what they need to store on their cloud at the
            right price for their budget. </p>

          <h4>Survey Analysis</h4>
          <p>I began by gathering feedback from users to help guide me through
            this project.</p>

                  <p>This question made me aware that many users use their cloud
                  storage app mainly for work purposes so I knew that the app I
                  would design had to be a professional platform.</p>

          <h4>User Stories and User Flows</h4>
          <p>I created user stories, a site map and user flows to lay the
            foundation for the structure of the Seraph app. Each user story was
            directly related to the problems facing users of cloud storage apps
            and the goals they need to accomplish. I prioritized the tasks in my
            user stories based on data I gathered from users in my survey.</p>

            between whether to use a horizontal or vertical navigation menu.
            Gathering more feedback from users and user testing really is what
            helped me make my final decision later on.</p>

            learn how to continue to improve and simplify the app. After testing
            it became apparent to me that the location of the new button did not
            stand out to users immediately in the right hand navigation menu.
            The location of the dropdown menu for each file and folder was also
            difficult for users to spot in this design.</p>

          <p>The logo is the concept of an angel because it’s a protector in the
            clouds. Gathering color images for the brand helped me find a middle
            ground between the idea of an angel as a stone statue and more
            infantile images of angels. The idea of a superhero was what really
            helped me tie these attributes together and I modeled the logo after
            the S in Superman.</p>

            second and third iterations of the product. In these iterations of
            the product I tried to make the new button more prominent by placing

          <h2>Conculsion</h2>
          <p>The Seraph project went through several major changes in design
            throughout its development to discover which design would be most
            intuitive for users. Listening to individual users helped me realize
            the problems with cloud storage apps currently on the market which
            gave me direction to help solve those problems through Seraph’s design.
            This project taught me the importance of conducting several rounds of
            user testing and how to implement changes more efficiently with the
            tools that I was using.</p>
