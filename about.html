          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>Hello again!  Paulina here.
            I wasn’t always a UX/UI Designer but I did a lot of designing.
            In my previous life (as a teacher) - I loved designing educational
            materials that made learning easier for my students. Every last
            detail about my day was thought through from the colors and fonts I
            used to my word choice because it was all part of conveying my
            messages effectively. Teaching was a constant assessment of what my
            students needed to hear, see or experience to help me help their
            learning process. After about a decade in the field, maybe because I
            love adventure, I dropped everything, moved to NY and became curious
            about what else I could offer the world. Along the way I met a
            couple of UX Designers and fell in love with the design process
            because I realized it incorporated a lot of the things I enjoyed
            doing as a teacher. I decided to embark on a yearlong mentorship to
            learn about user experience design and frontend development. The
            thing I enjoyed learning about the most was how to make digital
            products more accessible for users of all different backgrounds
            since I consider myself an advocate for diversity and minority
            groups. I’ve always been motivated by helping people and I like what
            I do now because it’s a way for me to continue using the skills I
            developed to help people in innovative ways. I’m interested in using
            design as a tool to help people help others or help themselves in
            positive ways. I invite you to check out my work and connect with me
            to see how we could work together!</p>
